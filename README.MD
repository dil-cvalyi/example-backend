### Questions
#### NodeJS
* What is the package.json
* What is the package-lock.json
* How routing works in a nodejs backend (e.g fastify or express)
  * What happens with a request when it hits an endpoint
* Why/how an API becomes RESTful
  * Have you heard about GraphQL? (If yes elaborate)
* What does authentication mean
  * JWT in general
  * Headers
  * Cookies
* What does authorization mean

#### Database
* How a database looks like
  * What are the building blocks
* What type of basic commands do you know
* What do you know about constraints, why are they important
* What are database indices, what they help us achieve


### Combined question
* Let's say we have a frontend and a backend. We are requesting some data on the FE from our BE.
  Can you describe the flow that is happening, or should happen from the moment the request leaves the browser.
  * If not mentioned ask about:
    * BE side validation
    * Status code
    * Authentication
    * Authorization
    * Error handling

Idea:
Put together a simple repo with backend and some SQL.
Have a PR opened with some issues. Let the candidate go through the PR and see what he/she "flags" and why.
